Refactoring Python
==================

Repo for my YouTube Series on Refactoring based on the book "Refactoring" by Martin Fowler

Each lesson is its in own folder with 4 files, `before.py`, `test_before.py`, `after.py` and `test_after.py`.

For exmpale if we want to learn about the extract method, we would go to:

```bash
> cd src/extract_method
> ls
before.py test_before.py
after.py test_after.py
```


## Install

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Its mainly just pytest as a requirement for testing
```
